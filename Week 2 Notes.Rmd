## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# start adding code 
#RMarkdown formats the document well
#need data of the same type in matrix
# hi prof di fiore, I hope you are having an amazing weekend
# this weekend I am hoping to see some friends and avoid getting COVID 19
# maybe I should use Rmarkdown as my personal journal
m[]
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
